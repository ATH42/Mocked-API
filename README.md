## About

Welcome to Mocked-API, this is a live API that can be accessed by anyone who needs data to test out their website, app, components etc.

## Getting Started

## FAQ

**Q:** Are you planning to add more end points?
**A:** I plan to add as many as I can, if there is a specific endpoint of data you would like to see feel free to add a Issue Request.
